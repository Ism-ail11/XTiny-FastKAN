## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project introduces **XTiny-FastKAN**, a lightweight, interpretable, and highly efficient neural network for **gesture-based air handwriting recognition** of the **Tifinagh script**, targeting real-time inference on low-power **TinyML microcontrollers**.

This work includes:
- A novel **Tifinagh IMU-based air-writing dataset**
- A rasterization pipeline to transform motion trajectories into color-encoded images
- A customized version of **FastKAN** optimized for TinyML
- Robust **data augmentation** and preprocessing strategies
- Reproducible training, evaluation, and explainability via saliency maps

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… First air-writing dataset for **Tifinagh characters**  
âœ… Compact and fast model (~35 KB, < 0.05ms latency)  
âœ… Compatible with **TensorFlow Lite Micro / Edge Impulse**  
âœ… Includes **data augmentation**, training scripts, and **confusion matrix tools**  
âœ… Built-in **XAI module** (saliency visualization)
